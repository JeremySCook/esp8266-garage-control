Arduino IDE code for Wemos D1 mini/ESP8266

"GarageServer-generic.ino" so named because it does not have actual WiFi name and PW filled in.
Place this, as well as the webpage.h file in the same directory before uploading to ESP8266 module.

Code is based on [Brian Lough's work found here](https://github.com/witnessmenow/WiFi-WFH-Indicator/tree/master/WFH_SIGN_WIFI_WEB). Thanks so much for your help getting this to run reliably, Brian!
